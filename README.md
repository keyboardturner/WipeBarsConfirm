# WipeBarsConfirm
Makes as clickable button in both Edit Mode and the Talents frame to wipe your action bars of all abilities.
<p>Ever log in to an old alt character after a billion years of taking a break and find it'd be easier to just nuke all your buttons off your action bars and begin anew? Well this may be the solution for you.</p>
<p>This addon creates a clickable button in Edit Mode and the Talents frame to wipe all buttons off your action bars (for your currently selected talent build).</p>
<p>When the clickable button is pressed, it will open a dialog popup box asking to confirm if you wish to wipe your action bars.</p>
<p>Additionally this provides a chat command of "/wipebars" that does functionally the same thing as the clickable buttons.</p>
